# RFC 168, by Johan Vromans: Built-in functions should be functions

Johan's proposal was to completely obliterate the difference between built-in
functions, such as `abs`, can be called both as a prefix operator, as well as
a function taking a single argument.

You see, Perl has this concept of built-in functions that are slightly more
equal than other functions (aka subroutines).  You can refer to a subroutine
"by reference" by prefixing `&` to its name, but that doesn't quite work like
that for built-in functions in Perl.

Now, in Raku, the difference between a subroutine taking a single positional
argument, and a built-in prefix operator whose name is acceptable as an
identifier, is already minimal.  Well, actually absent.  Suppose we want to
define a prefix operator `foo` that has the same semantics as `abs`:

  sub foo(Numeric:D $value) {
      $value < 0 ?? -$value !! $value
  }

  say foo -42;  # 42

You can't really see a difference, now can you?  Well, the reason is simple:
in Raku, there **is** no real difference between the `foo` subroutine, and the
`abs` operator.  They're **both** just subroutines: just look at the
[definition of the `abs` function for `Real` numbers](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Real.pm6#L170).

The RFC also mentions:

  In particular, it is desired that every built-in
  - can be overridden by a user defined subroutine;
  - can have a reference taken;
  - has a useful prototype.

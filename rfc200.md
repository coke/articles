# RFC 200, by Nathan Wiger: Revamp tie to support extensibility

[Proposed on 7 September 2000](https://raku.org/archive/rfc/200.html),
frozen on 20 September 2000, depends on
[RFC 159: True Polymorphic Objects](https://raku.org/archive/rfc/159.html)
proposed on 25 August 2000, frozen on 16 September 2000, also by *Nathan Wiger*.


# Conclusion

RFC's 168 and 26 have been implemented completely, although maybe not in the
way the original RFC's envisioned.  In a way that nowadays just feels very
natural.  Which allows us to build further, on the shoulders of giants!

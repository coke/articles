Multi-Dispatch in Perl 6
========================

This is the ninth article in
[a series of articles](https://opensource.com/users/lizmat) about migrating
code from Perl 5 to Perl 6.  In this article we'll be looking at the
multi-dispatch core feature of Perl 6.

Perl 5 doesn't have multi-dispatch as a core feature, but it does have two
modules on CPAN that provide a subset of the functionality of Perl 6
multi-dispatch:
[Class::Multimethods](https://metacpan.org/pod/Class::Multimethods) by Damian
Conway, and
[MooseX::MultiMethods](https://metacpan.org/pod/MooseX::MultiMethods) by
Florian Ragwitz.  The former clearly providing inspiration to the
multi-dispatch of Perl 6, and the latter clearly being inspired by
multi-dispatch of Perl 6.  The cross-pollination between Perl 5 and Perl 6
is very clear.

On Raku
=======

Please note that all opinions stated in this article are mine, and mine alone.
No consensus of any kind with any group is intended or implied.  All resulting
comments and related outbursts of opinion, should be directed at me.

Very recently, I was asked to
[clarify my stance](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9m2k6l/a_request_to_larry_wall_to_create_a_language_name/e7cdgih/)
on the Perl 6 naming debate.  In short: I don't think there should be another
name for Perl 6, other than perhaps a nickname that would indicate the
implementation.  So "Rakudo Perl 6" or just "Rakudo".  This has been in use
for many years already, and most definitely since Christmas 2015 when the first
official release of Perl 6 was presented to the world.

Perl 6 is the successor of Perl 5.  Just like Perl 5 was the successor of
Perl 4.  That is the way it was intended originally, and that is the way that
it should go in the future.  Anything else would do a disservice to all people
involved in the Perl community.

Because the implementation of Perl 6 has taken much longer than anticipated,
Perl 5 has suffered a lot from
[cannibalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalization_(marketing)).
Which in turn caused a braindrain to other languages, because Perl 5 was
perceived to be dead because of the coming of Perl 6.  This can not be denied.
What also can not be denied, that a lot of Perl 5 code written during the
dot-com boom, was not written by the best of programmers: having been
responsible for clearing out the final bits of original code written by the
founder of a startup that is now a multi-billion dollar company providing jobs
for 20K+ people, I think I know what that was like.  So I think I can say
the the demise of Perl 5, was not caused by Perl 6.

Some people will actually argue that Perl 6 was an attempt to *stop* the
already started demise of Perl 5.

Regardless of other reasons for the demise of Perl 5 in the world, Perl 6 has
become the scapegoat as the sole reason for the problems of Perl 5 by many
members of the Perl community.

Renaming requests from Perl 5 users
-----------------------------------
The fact that Perl 5 will always have a version number with a **5** in it,
is seen by many as the source of the problem of not having any future for
Perl 5.  Hence, many have asked for Perl 6 to be renamed.  And perhaps that
would have been a good thing at one point in time: but since its first official
release in December 2015, that ship has sailed for good.  There are now many
Perl 6 books out in the world, 2 published by O'Reilly.  Renaming the current
Perl 6 to something else, and then claiming version numbers with **6** in them
for the current Perl 5 code base, is just going to add to the massive
confusion that already exists.  So that will never happen.

Renaming requests from Perl 6 users
-----------------------------------
Perl 6 users have asked for Perl 6 to be renamed, because the association
with Perl / Perl 5 is very strong.  And currently has a very negative
connotation.  This association could have been prevented had Perl 6 been given
another name in the past.  But again, that ship has sailed when the first
official release of Perl 6 was presented to the world in December 2015.
From my point of view, the strong association can be made into a positive
asset given anough time and effort.  And I still believe in that.

Badgering
---------
But people have continued badgering Larry Wall for another name.  One of them
very public at the
[Perl Conference in Amsterdam](https://youtu.be/E5t8qaAGw9w?t=4886):

> The whole naming thing we've gone over so many times.  I do think that
> we could have other terms by which Perl or Perl distributions are marketed.
> They don't have to be marketed necessarily as Perl, especially in markets
> where that's a swear word... But my interest and feeling is that Perl is
> my thing and whether Perl 5 or Perl 6 that's really the name of the whole
> culture.  And that's why we're all here together.

Recently
[another campaign](https://perl6.party/post/A-Request-to-Larry-Wall-to-Create-a-Language-Name-Alias-for-Perl-6)
was started to give Perl 6 an "extra name".  It stated:

> As such, we are creating an alias only. One that does not have any reference
> to Perl in it (i.e. no "Perl++"). If another name is truly as superior as
> the full-rename proponents claim it would be, I believe the alias can become
> a defacto name through its sheer amount of use. Thus, the creation of the
> alias can be seen as a means for the full-rename proponents to prove their
> claims.

Larry Wall
[had some ideas about that](https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-25#l468) as a stage name: "It's the stage name (but Perl 6
still cashes the checks)".  And very recently Larry Wall finally,
[very casually without much formality](https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-11-03#l276)
said that if people wanted to have an "extra name", it should be "raku".

A step back
-----------
Before I go on, I would like to elaborate on the definition of "stage name"
[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_name):

> A performer will often take a stage name because his/her real name is
> considered unattractive...

In the early 60s, having a German name in the United States was considered
an impediment to success in the music business.  So a guy called Robert
Allen Zimmerman decides to
[change his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan#Origins_and_musical_beginnings):

> You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens.
> You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the
> free.

So he called himself "Bob Dylan" and became a world famous artist performing
to crowds of many thousands to this day.

What do you think would have happened if he had changed his name to:
`Bob "Dylan" Zimmerman`?  Would he have been as successful?  Probably not,
as the negative connotation of "Zimmerman" would still have applied.

Things wrong with the use of "raku"
-----------------------------------
Ever since Larry Wall mentioned that "raku" would have his blessing as a
**stage name**, the name "raku" has been used **in conjunction** with Perl 6.
`"Raku" Perl 6`.  So, `Bob "Dylan" Zimmerman`.

This is **not** the use of "Raku" as a stage name.  It is even in direct
conflict with what was proposed in the last campaign.  In my opinion, it is
effectively a
[thinly veiled attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9tws89/its_raku/e90y64u/)
at [rebranding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebranding) "Perl 6" to the
name "Raku", thereby being completely passing by the "Perl community"
component that Larry Wall mentioned at the Perl Conference in Amsterdam.

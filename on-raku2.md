On Raku (Again)
===============
But before going on that, I would like to thank **Zoffix Znet** for all of the
work he's done for Perl, Perl 6 in particular and lately to get the 6.d
language release of Perl 6 out of the door.  Something he has worked on for
almost 1.5 year, ever since he posted a blog about the
[Hot New Language Named Rakudo](https://perl6.party/post/The-Hot-New-Language-Named-Rakudo)
([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/6lstq3/the_hot_new_language_named_rakudo/) comments).

But that's not the only thing he's written about.  In total he's written
[66 blogposts](https://perl6.party) in roughly the past 2 years.  That's more
than one every two weeks on average.  And all about Perl 6!

> ... it's things like these that make me enjoy programming in Perl 6. It's

Zoffix, thank you for reminding me about that.  It's a feeling that I still
get, although not as often as before, I must admit.  But that is **also** the
sensation that I am going for.  We may not agree on the naming issue, and
possibly some other minor issues, but I think you've made Perl 6 better than
it was before.  And I am thankful for that.  Zoffix++

About habits
------------
Kicking the habit of programming in pursuit for that "wonder" feeling is hard.
But possible.

Another habit that is hard to break, is to meet up with people in real life
that share your interests in Perl.  Those gatherings are fun to do, and a good
break away from life behind the keyboard.  But such a habit can also be broken.
One will just have to arrange to meet people you like without needing a Perl
event.

And here I am seriously considering just to do that: leave Perl (in all its
forms) and focus on something else that will have a bigger amount of fun.  At
this point in time, this includes a *lot* of potential activities.

World View
----------
My view of the Perl world has been formed by many different experiences.
First by Perl 4 when trying to start up a web development company in 1994.
Secondly by a pretty buggy and slow Perl 5 from 1995 and onwards.  Thirdly
by going to Perl Monger Meetings, and then organizing them.  From there on
to organizing Perl one-day workshops and multi-day Perl conferences with more
than 300 people attending. Followed by an 8 year hiatus while being busy
helping to grow a company from 35 people to 5000 using Perl, instead of Java
that was recommended by the new owners.  Then, gradually easing into talking
to strangers at generic open source events such as T-Dose, FOSDEM, OSCON.
From strangers that just drop by to scream "Perl should die" to your face
(just a single one, but repeat offender).  To strangers that tell you they're
happy to see Perl still alive, that they miss Perl, having to program in
another language for a living, and that they're looking forward to the moment
that they once again will be able to pick up Perl where they left off.

These people are not typically very verbal in online forums.  But like
everybody else nowadays, follow blogs and online news sources.   It's from
them that I know that the "sister language" narrative is something that
really only has meaning inside the Perl echo chamber.  Outside of it, people
are generally interested in new and fun things to do.  And Perl 6 is for
increasingly more people, one of those.

That is **my** world view.  Which does not include any managers discarding
Perl on the grounds of the name or perceived status.  Simply because **I**
have never had to deal with that.  You could argue that I have been extremely
lucky in my life.  Perhaps.  But I also think you need to force your luck in
life by being diligent, by being assertive and by being able to explain why
things didn't work out the way they were planned.  And make clear to people
that programming is in fact a creative profession, that requires practice,
practice, practice, practice and a little inspiration.  And a certain
stubborness, specifically when explaining things to people that do not
understand.

Back to Raku
------------
It is for these reasons that I have decided to stand by my proposal from my
[previous blog post](https://liztormato.wordpress.com/2018/11/06/on-raku/)
which I will reiterate here:

- any mention of "Raku" should be removed from all Perl 6 marketing materials
- any mention of "Raku" should be removed from all Perl 6 documentation
- a separate "Raku" distribution (a la Rakudo Star) should be made
  - in which all mentions to Perl 6 are automatically changed to "Raku"
- people marketing "Raku" need only concern themselves with "Raku"
  - and are free to do so in any which way they seem fit

This is the basic idea.  People with a Perl 5 background will have a
**genuine** *chance* that Perl 6 will disappear from their life should
"Raku" become the success *outside* of the current Perl community that
everybody wants for the programming language that Perl 6 is.

I hope that either Larry Wall (as BDFL), or Jonathan Worthington (the
current Perl 6 pumpkin) will want to express their opinion about this idea.
Until I hear otherwise from them, **I** will continue as if my proposal has
been accepted.  And if I **do** hear otherwise from either of them, then I
will need to take that fact of life under advisement.

Winding down
------------
Until then, I intend to publish a Perl 6 Weekly again next Monday, and
continue on a weekly schedule afterwards.

I intend to write up an impartial as possible review of the discussions about
"raku" of the past 10 days or so.

Because it is the **Perl 6** Weekly, that will most likely be the last time
I mention "Raku" in the Perl 6 Weekly.

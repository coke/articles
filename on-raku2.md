On Raku (Again)
===============

Before going on, I would like to thank Zoffix Znet for all of the work he's
done for Perl, Perl 6 in particular and lately to get the 6.d language release
out of the door.  Something he worked on for almost 1.5 years, ever since he
posted a blog about the
[Hot New Language Named Rakudo](https://perl6.party/post/The-Hot-New-Language-Named-Rakudo).  But that's not the only thing he's written about.  In total
he's written [66 blogposts] in roughly the past 2 years.  That's more than
one every two weeks on average.

And that's a feeling that I still get, although not as often as before, I
must admit.  But that **is** the sensation I'm going for.  Kicking that
habit is hard.

Winding down
------------
I intend to publish a Perl 6 Weekly again next Monday.

I intend to write up an impartial as possible review of the discussions about
"raku" of the past 10 days or so.

Because it is the **Perl 6** Weekly, that will most likely be the last time
I mention "raku" in the Perl 6 Weekly.

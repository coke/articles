On Raku (Again)
===============
Before going on, I would like to thank Zoffix Znet for all of the work he's
done for Perl, Perl 6 in particular and lately to get the 6.d language release
out of the door.  Something he worked on for almost 1.5 years, ever since he
posted a blog about the
[Hot New Language Named Rakudo](https://perl6.party/post/The-Hot-New-Language-Named-Rakudo)
([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/6lstq3/the_hot_new_language_named_rakudo/) comments).

But that's not the only thing he's written about.  In total he's written
[66 blogposts](https://perl6.party) in roughly the past 2 years.  That's more
than one every two weeks on average.

Zoffix, thank you for reminding me about that.  It's a feeling that I still
get, although not as often as before, I must admit.  But that **is** the
sensation I'm going for.  Kicking that habit is hard.  But possible.

Another habit that is hard to break, is to meet up with people in real life
that share your interests in Perl.  Those gatherings are fun to do, and a good
break away from life behind the keyboard.  But such a habit can also be broken.
One will just have to arrange to meet people you like outside of a Perl event.

And here I am seriously considering just to do that: leave Perl (in all its
forms) and focus on something else that will have some amount of fun.

World View
----------
My view of the Perl world has been formed by many different experiences.
First by Perl 4 when trying to start up a web development company in 1994.
Secondly by a pretty buggy and slow Perl 5 from 1995 and onwards.  Thirdly
by going to Perl Monger Meetings, and then organizing them.  From there on
to organizing Perl one-day workshops and multi-day Perl conferences with more
than 300 people attending.  Followed by talking to strangers at general open
source events such as T-Dose, FOSDEM, OSCON.  From strangers that just drop
by to scream "Perl should die" into your face (just a single one, but repeat
offender).  To strangers that tell you they're happy to see Perl still alive,
that they miss Perl having to program in another language for a living, and
that they're looking forward to once be able to pick up Perl where they left
off.

These people are not typically very verbal in online forums.  But like
everybody else nowadays, follow blogs and online news sources.  And its
from them that I know that the "sister language" narrative is something
that only has meaning inside the Perl echo chamber.  Outside of it, people
are generally interested in new and fun things to do.  And Perl 6 is for
increasingly more people, one of those.

That is my world view.  Which does not include any managers discarding
Perl on the grounds of the name or perceived status.  Simply because **I**
have never had to deal with that.  And you could argue that I have been
extremely lucky in my life.  Perhaps.  But I also think you need to force
your luck in life by being diligent, by being able to explain why things
didn't work out the way they were planned.  And make clear to people that
programming is in fact a creative profession, that requires practice,
practice, practice, practice and a little inspiration.  And a certain
stubborness.

Standing my ground
------------------


Winding down
------------
I intend to publish a Perl 6 Weekly again next Monday.

I intend to write up an impartial as possible review of the discussions about
"raku" of the past 10 days or so.

Because it is the **Perl 6** Weekly, that will most likely be the last time
I mention "raku" in the Perl 6 Weekly.
